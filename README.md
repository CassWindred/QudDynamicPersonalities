# Dynamic Personalities

## Potential Features:
1. **Personal Opinion**: An individuals opinion will be based on your reputation with their faction combined with their personal opinion on you.
2. **Personality Traits**: Every object with a brain has a personality. These personalities are by and large defined by traits. These traits modify the objects behaviour. While traits are mostly randomly generated, some traits are always found on certain creatures, for instance, all merchants are mercentile, so they are willing to trade with you even if they have a low opinion of you.
3. **Names**: No more are names a scarce resource, given only to those of particular importance - now everyone has a name, though you might need to get to know them a bit before they will tell you it!
3. **Gifts**: Everyone loves gifts! Find out what people like by asking their friends, or just by guessing based on what you know about them, and raise their opinion of you to the moon! Gifts have diminishing return, however, giving the same thing over and over again will eventually lose its charm.
4. **Relationships**: You arent the only person the citizens of Qud care about, and indeed everyone has their own sets of relationships, usually with those who live close by.
5. **Boundaries**: Everyone has personal boundaries, requiring a certain amount of opinion to overcome. Not everyone wants to trade with everyone they meet, most people require a decent rapport before water-bonding with you, and joining you on your travels is the kind of commitment left only for the closest of friends - or those who just love travelling.
6. **Conversations**: Have friendly conversations with those willing to engage. Choose a topic and chat freely, improving their personal opinion of you, providing you dont accidentally insult them of course.
